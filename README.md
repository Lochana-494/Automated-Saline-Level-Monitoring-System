The Automated Saline Level Management System is designed to improve patient safety and reduce manual intervention in hospitals. It continuously monitors saline levels using load cell sensors and transmits real-time data via an IoT module (ESP32) to a cloud-based mobile app.

When the saline level goes below a critical threshold, the system triggers a buzzer alert and sends notifications to medical staff. If no action is taken within a set time, the system automatically stops the saline flow using a servo-controlled valve to prevent air embolism.

Additionally, healthcare professionals can remotely adjust the saline flow rate through an app, ensuring better patient care and reduced nurse workload. The system can be integrated into smart hospitals and home healthcare solutions for seamless monitoring and control.
